## üí° About <a name = "about"></a>
Inventory Module is a full-stack project which simulates a web platform for the administration of inventory in a company.

It uses the Single Web Application (SPA) methodology by rendering different components depending on the option chosen. As well, it uses a ReactJS with Bootstrap library to make the Frontend User Interface and .NET Core (C#) for the APIs in the backend.

The program connects with a relational database using MS SQL Server running locally, which is why a SQL migration script is provided. Additionally, it has been developed and tested in Visual Studio 2022, as it locally deploys both the backend and frontend with IIS Server.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

The software requirements and their versions are listed in the <a name = "built_using" href="#built_using"> Built Using </a> section. However, it would be necesary to use a Windows machine that can support the versions of the listed software.

Before starting the project, the database should be running locally. To do so, install Microsoft SQL Server 2022 and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 18 to visualize the database. 

After the installation, find the "migration.sql" file in the "sql" directory. Open it with SSMS 18 and execute it with the "Execute" button or pressing "F5". With that, you'll have the database working locally.

### Installing

Clone the repository locally with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/avi-2-avi/inventory-module.git
```

Open the directory and navigate to the "src" directory. Open the "InventoryModule.sln" file in Visual Studio 2022.

In the search bar of Visual Studio 2022, which is located in the upper part, look for "Manage NuGet Packages" and make sure that the following packages versions are installed:

Package | Version 
---|---
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer | 6.0.10 
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools | 6.0.11 
Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaProxy | 6.0.11 

<!--Connecting to DB (for development)-->
<!---
Command for connecting to the database using Scaffold-DbContext in Package Manager Console (Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console):
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/powershell

Make sure your local database has Windows authentication mode or it won't work.

```
Scaffold-DbContext "Server=(local); DataBase=Inventory;Integrated Security=true;TrustServerCertificate=True" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutPutDir Models
```
-->

After that, execute the project using "F5" or the InventoryModule button with the play icon. If everything was done correctly, the program will execute. 

If the data is not showing, make sure that the database is running locally and that it has "Windows Authentication", or else it won't work. If the program in not starting, make sure you have all the necesarry software installed.

### Database
The "Inventory" database consists of only one table, where "code" is the primary key of the Items table.
